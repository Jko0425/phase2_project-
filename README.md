# Predicting Housing Prices in King County, Seattle

## Overview

Prices of homes are always fluctuating. And with many companies looking at homes as investment pieces, it is imperative for these companies to purchase or sell these homes at optimal prices in order to maximize their profits. But how does a company know which price is fair and when to sell or buy? By looking at the data provided, specifically in King County, we can observe how the housing market has changed and create a predictive model that will return a fair price of a home.

## Business Problem

There are many variables that may affect the price of a home. For instance, houses closer to the water may have greater demand and therefore have higher prices than houses inland. To properly calculate these prices, we can isolate each variable in order to determine which variable is most influential. This can be done by keeping certain variables constant.
Another problem may be looking at home prices in previous years. The housing market is similar to the stock market in that it changes through time. Although it may be useful to look at prices from previous years to predict trends, the prices of homes will be reactionary to the latest data.

## Data

The data was provided by the [Flatiron School](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project-v2-5). It provideds details of homes in King County, Seattle. It contains homes sold/purchased between the years of 2021 and 2022. From the data, we can observe how price has changed throughout the years, and how each variable affects the price.
